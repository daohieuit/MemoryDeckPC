2. Under **"Create New Deck"**, type a name (e.g., "Daily Phrases" or "Unit 1").
3. Click **"Create Deck"**. The app will automatically open the editor for your new deck.

### Accessing Deck Editor
You can access the deck editor in two ways:
1.  **From the Dashboard**: On the main Dashboard, each deck now features a small pencil icon ✎ in its top-right corner. Clicking this icon will take you directly to the "My Decks" page with that specific deck expanded and ready for editing.
2.  **From My Decks Page**: Navigate to the "My Decks" page, find your desired deck, and click the "Edit" button.

### Adding and Editing Cards
1. In the **"My Decks"** list, find your deck and click it to expand the details.

3. To add cards manually:
    - Click **"Add New"** to show the entry form.

## 🎓 Learning Modes

MemoryDeck offers four distinct modes to challenge your retrieval memory. Navigate to the **"Dashboard"** and click on a deck to start learning.

### 1. Flashcards (SRS)
The core study tool. Flip the card to reveal the definition.
- **Easy/Good/Hard**: Rate your difficulty. The system uses this to determine when you should see the card again.
- **Progress Tracking**: The progress bar at the top shows how far you've come in your current session.

### 2. Quiz Mode
Test your word-to-definition recognition. Choose the correct answer from four multiple-choice options.

### 3. Matching Game
A high-speed recognition test. Match the word cards with their corresponding definitions as fast as possible to clear the board.

### 4. Spelling Check
The ultimate test of pronunciation and orthography.
- Click the **"Listen"** icon to hear the word.
- Type the word exactly as spelled.
- This mode is perfect for mastering spelling and reinforcing the connection between sound and text.
