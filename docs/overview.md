# Project Overview: MemoryDeck

**MemoryDeck** is more than just a flashcard app; it's a cognitive-first environment designed to bridge the gap between "learning" and "mastery" through structured active recall and native desktop reliability.

## 🧠 Our Philosophy

Traditional learning often relies on passive reading, which creates an "illusion of competence." MemoryDeck is built on three scientific pillars:

1. **Active Recall**: Forcing your brain to retrieve information from scratch rather than just recognizing it.
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Optimizing the interval between reviews based on your "Easy", "Good", or "Hard" feedback for each term.
3. **Multi-Sensory Input**: Combining visual text, manual typing (in Spelling Mode), and auditory cues (TTS) to build stronger neural pathways.

## ⭐ Core Features

### Quick Deck Editing
Users can now instantly access a deck's editing interface directly from the Dashboard, streamlining the workflow for managing and updating their vocabulary.

### The "Deck" Ecosystem
Users organize information into modular "Decks." This modularity allows for focused study sessions, preventing cognitive overload and allowing for categorical mastery.

### Spaced Repetition Flashcards
Our flashcard engine tracks your responses. By marking a card as "Hard," you signal the system to prioritize that card in future sessions, ensuring you spend your time where it matters most. All progress is calculated in real-time based on your session history.

### Spelling Check Mode
By integrating the native browser/OS **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, we provide a listening-to-writing loop. This is essential for language learners who need to connect the sound of a word with its orthographic representation.

### Premium Design (Glassmorphism)
MemoryDeck features a modern aesthetic—using backdrop blurs (glassmorphism), soft shadows, and a curated "Nature" color palette (Greens and Slate) to create a premium workspace that feels both professional and calming.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- **ESL Students**: Mastering English for exams like TOEIC, IELTS, or TOEFL.
- **Self-Directed Learners**: Building custom knowledge bases for technical terms, hobbies, or professional growth.
- **Desktop Users**: Users who need a fast, native-feeling Windows application that works perfectly offline.

## 🛣 Future Roadmap
- **AI Card Generation**: (Planned) Integrating Google Gemini to automatically generate definitions, IPA transcriptions, and example sentences from a single word.
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: (Planned) Optional cloud syncing to keep your decks updated across multiple devices.
- **Audio Recording**: Allowing users to record their own pronunciation for comparison with the native TTS.
