# Project Overview: Memorydeck

Memorydeck is more than just a flashcard app; it's a cognitive-first environment designed to bridge the gap between "learning" and "mastery."

## 🧠 Our Philosophy

Traditional learning often relies on passive reading, which creates an "illusion of competence." Memorydeck is built on three scientific pillars:

1. **Active Recall**: Forcing your brain to retrieve information from scratch rather than just recognizing it.
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Optimizing the interval between reviews based on your personal difficulty levels.
3. **Multi-Sensory Input**: Combining visual text, manual typing, and auditory cues to build stronger neural pathways.

## ⭐ Core Features

### The "deck" Ecosystem
Users organize information into modular "decks." This modularity allows for focused study sessions, preventing cognitive overload.

### Intelligent Flashcards
Our flashcard engine tracks your responses. By marking a card as "Hard," you signal the system to prioritize that card in future sessions, ensuring you spend your time where it matters most.

### Spelling Check Mode
By integrating the **Web Speech API**, we provide a listening-to-writing loop. This is essential for language learners who need to connect the sound of a word with its orthographic representation.

### Premium Design (Claymorphism)
MemoryDeck features a modern "Claymorphism" aesthetic—using soft shadows, rounded corners, and vibrant gradients to create a tactile UI that feels friendly and encouraging.

## 🛣 Future Roadmap
- **AI Card Generation**: (Planned) Integrating Google Gemini to automatically generate definitions and example sentences.
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: (Planned) Optional cloud syncing via Appwrite.
- **Audio Recording**: Allowing users to record their own pronunciation for comparison.
